## riff system install

Install riff and Knative system components

### Synopsis

Install riff and Knative system components.

If an `istio-system` namespace isn't found, it will be created and Istio components will be installed. 
Use the `--node-port` flag when installing on Minikube and other clusters that don't support an external load balancer. 
Use the `--manifest` flag to specify the path or URL of a manifest file which provides the URLs of the kubernetes configuration files of the components to be installed. The manifest file contents should be of the following form:

    manifestVersion: 0.1
    istio:
    - https://path/to/istio-release.yaml
    knative:
    - https://path/to/build-release.yaml
    - https://path/to/serving-release.yaml
    - https://path/to/eventing-release.yaml
    namespace:
    - https://path/to/buildtemplate-release.yaml

Note: relative file paths or http/https URLs may be used in the manifest.

```
